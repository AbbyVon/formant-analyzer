This application calculates and plots the formant frequencies of spoken vowels. The user should speak a word containing a single vowel, and we will analyze and show results.

First two formant frequencies are used to graphically show the location of spoken vowel on a standard vowel diagram. An indicator light changes its color to display the status of the application.

This is made to assist with speech therapy and language learning as well as other research topics.
